# Vortox

Vortox is a super-optimized 3D game engine designed to deliver high performance and flexibility for high-quality games. The engine is built with the goal of being simple, fast, and efficient, allowing developers to create immersive experiences with minimal overhead.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Full support for 3D graphics using OpenGL. (LIE!)
- **Performance**: Focused on optimization and efficient resource usage.
- **Extensibility**: The engine is designed to be easily extensible, allowing you to add new features as needed.

## Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows platforms are not supported. (and I will never upload a Windows Release in the legacy code)

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Language**: G++ with C++20
- **Libraries**: OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW (or others depending on your setup)
- **Others**: Ensure that you have the appropriate graphics driver installed.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository

2. Build the engine:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Run Vortox (if build.sh didn't run it)

   ```bash
   ./build/bin/Vortox
   ```
