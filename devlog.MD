So, there we were, when I wrote this code, I really didn't know what the fuck I was doing. I didn't know much C/C++, so I was stuck. But, thanks a lot to Stack Overflow digging, I made my worst decision for this engine. I used 2.5D style, dude, what the fuck, why did I do that?

So, somes days, after a lot of stress, I finally decided to rewrite the damn, bad, project, and here it is, much better code now. I'm going to archive this old code because I'm merging the **DEVELOPMENT-NEW-CODE** branch to the **main** branch. Well, it's new code, so bye bye old mess 2.5D code.

I swear to god, I will never update this rusty 2.5D old code. I swear...

Good-bye mess code! You only served as an example for me in future to not write bad code...
